# how it works
there is a one byte flag in the flp that if set to 01 will make fl studio think it is not in trial mode 00 does the opposite
i just set the flag accordingly
it also sets all plugins/effects flags to the correct thing

## TODO

- ~~make fl studio 21 work with it (high importance)~~ prob never gonna work so use [the latest version of fl 20 (supplied by kstr)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFEy_mnZQPmSVDvZ5bE_FbIqAsGHadn9/view)
- ~~do a ui overhaul (not very important at all)~~ nvm done lol thanks plank
